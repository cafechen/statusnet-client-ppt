# StatusNet Desktop

The StatusNet Desktop and Mobile clients use the cross-platform Titanium toolkit,
which provides a nice JavaScript environment with various native platform access.

For full directions on building, see:

# StatusNet Mobile

The StatusNet Mobile build requires copying some shared files which currently reside
in the StatusNet Desktop subtree.

Note that the 'StatusNet Tablet' and 'StatusNet Blackberry' folders are stubs which copy most
of their contents from the Mobile dirs.


Some code for StatusNet Desktop is based on Tweetanium:

# Tweetanium

Tweetanium was one of the first reference applications for the Titanium Desktop SDK.  Based on the
awesome work of the Titanium development team and community, I figured it was time to bring it back
for both desktop and mobile.  We'll see where the project goes - maybe some people will like it 
enough to use it?  In any case, it will serve as a good example for folks looking to build desktop
and mobile apps with Titanium.

Like Titanium, Tweetanium is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source software license.
