It would be good if we can have separate app icons for iPhone and Android:

iPhone needs an icon which fills the entire area due to it not allowing transparency...
A glossy finish, rounded corners, and black background (if transparency) are
automatically added.

Android allows and encourages transparency in app icons, and adds no texture.

For now, we're using a compromise icon that has a rounded solid gradient background,
which looks sorta ok on both.



Android is also scaling our large app icon down very badly, while things look ok
on iPhone.

I've attempted making a separate version of the icon for Android; as documented
on Appcelerator's web site it *should* work to drop a same-named 'logo.png' into
Resources/android and it'll take, but this doesn't seem to actually do it.
